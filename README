==ge-android==
Using PhoneGap to run Go-Everywhere as a native app on Android.

==Usage==
To use ge-android, you must have these installed:

*) The latest version of node.js
*) The latest version of phonegap (sudo npm install -g phonegap)
-Optional-
*) A local clone of the Go-Everywhere repository (https://github.com/GoEverywhere/Go-Everywhere.git), and the environment variable $GE set to the root of the Go-Everywhere local repo

Running the app:

1) If this is the first time you are running the app on your computer (or you want to update the Go-Everywhere files to be put on the device), go run www/update_ge.sh
[If you do not have $GE set, the script will download the latest version of Go-Everywhere from the Go-Everywhere repo]

2) In a Terminal, browse to the location of ge-android, and run:
phonegap run android

3) For MacOSX users, if you want to do the above steps all in one gesture, run "android-run.command".
